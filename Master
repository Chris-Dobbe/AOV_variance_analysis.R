# AOV analysis of Variance functions, testing a hypothesis with a categorical explanatory variable
# and a quantitative response variable, we find out if there is a stat. significant difference between
# the different categorical variables by comparing their mean values
# null hypothesis is all means are equal, so a non-zero, small p value will disprove the hypothesis

data$Expt <- factor(data1$Expt)             # need your cat. variable to be a factor, so convert it here

boxplot(Speed ~ Expt, data=data1)           # shows a boxplots for the key metric by one dimension
means <- round(tapply(data1$Speed, data1$Expt, fun = mean), digits = 2)        # calculates the means of cat. variables
means                                       # shows the means for each cat. variable
aov_val <- aov(Speed ~ Expt, data=data1)    # creates boxplots of each cat. variable
summary(aov_val)                            # provides degrees of freedom, mean squares, and p value, a p value

# To disprove the null hypothesis, we want large F-value &  very tiny p-value (<0.05)

qqnorm(residuals(aov_val))                  # normal plot of the residuals
qqline(residuals(aov_val))                  # plots best fit line along the residuals
plot(fitted(aov_val), residuals(aov_val))   # plots spread of residuals by cat. variable
abline(h=0)                                 # includes the median line to show how each cat. variable residuals are spread to median

# by now you can accept/reject hypothesis that all means are equal

# to determine if there are sign. differences in means between the individual cat. variables, use the Tukey post hoc test
tuk <- TukeyHSD(aov_val)
tuk
# the result list will show the diff, and adjusted P value between each of means of the cat. variables
# This allows us to determine which cat. variables are similar, and which are different
